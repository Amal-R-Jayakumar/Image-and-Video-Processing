# Image-and-Video-Processing
Video and image capturing and processing through Python 3.
This folder contains files that can be used for image processing using Python 

video_to_image_and_split_into_four_parts program captures image from webcam and cuts it into four equal parts. The VideoCapture object is named video. the webcam port can be changed according to the need by changing the value of "web_cam_port" in line 54 to -1 or 1 for default webcam. it is usually 0 When the object "video" recieves input, the value of "video.isOpened()" becomes TRUE. Here "frame" is the video matrix in the while loop. When the webcam feed is opened, the user can choose to quit by pressing 'q' or the 'ESC' key. This will delete the video matrix and the program will be terminated. If the user wants to capture image, press 'SPACE' or 's' Key. This action will capture the image. The image is saved as 'Capture.png'. Then the function to crop images will take over and save and display 4 individual images. The images are created by taking 'Capture.png' into a matrix named'image'. 'Height' and 'Width' of the capture is read and a new matrix named 'crop' is created each time changing the dimensions. The cropped images will be displayed. Then press 'q' or 'ESC' to close the windows.
